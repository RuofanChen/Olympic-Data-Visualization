# Olympic Data Visualization
## Data 
The data I propose to visualize for my project is the Olympic data from 2000 to 2014. It is extracted from kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games).  
The [oylmpic dataset](https://gist.github.com/RuofanChen/b8ab70bdb93f363cf55e6390ad39805b) used for this project is posted on github gist. 

This dataset describes the performance of different countries in every Olympic Games (Summer and Winter).

Data key features:
* Year (quantitative): Year
* Medal (categorical): Which medal (gold, silver or bronze) did this athlete obtain
* Country (categorical): Which country of political groups does this athlete belong to
* Population (quantitative): The population of this county or political group
* GDP.per.Capita (quantitative): The GDP/population for different country


## Questions & Tasks
The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:  

* Do most countries perform differently in the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics?
* How does GDP per capita affect a country's performance?
* The trend of the number of medal for each country w.r.t. time.

## Sketches
(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine) (describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks). 



## Prototypes
Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data.
